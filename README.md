# SillyBus
Sillybus is a web application that allows users to upload their Syllabi and sync the due dates with their Google Calendar.
## Dependencies
- Django
- python-dotenv
- google-api-python-client
- google-auth-httplib2
- google-auth-oauthlib
- convertapi
- tempfile


## Use Case
A student uploads their syllabi and the due dates are synced with their Google Calendar. The alternative that many students face is manually adding the due dates to their calendar, which is time-consuming and error-prone as well as extremely boring.
## Why its interesting
This project allowed us to work directly with the Google API and the Convert API, which allowed us find a practical use for machine learning that could help students' everyday life.
